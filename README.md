# Natural Language Question Answering over IFC Building Models using LLMs and Graph-RAG
This project demonstrates how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation to parse and query Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files. It allows users to ask plain-language questions about BIM data and get accurate answers powered by GPT-4o and a Neo4j graph database.

## Project Overview

The system has two main stages:

1. **Graph Generation** â€“ Converts an IFC file into a graph format using IFCOpenShell and stores it in Neo4j.
2. **LLM-based QA System** â€“ Uses GPT-4o with prompt engineering to answer questions about the IFC model using Cypher queries.
3. **Main Script** â€“ Coordinates the full pipeline from parsing to user interaction.
